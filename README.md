# 🧠 Decision Tree Project – Sleep Quality Predictor

Predicting **sleep quality** (Poor / Average / Good) using lifestyle data and a Decision Tree algorithm.

---

## 📖 Project Description

In this project, we explore how factors like caffeine intake, screen time, exercise, and stress levels impact sleep quality.  
Using a **Decision Tree Classifier**, we train a model that can predict whether someone’s sleep falls into the “Poor”, “Average”, or “Good” category.

Key steps include:

- **Data Preprocessing**  
  Converting categorical features (Caffeine_Intake, Exercise, Stress_Level, Sleep_Quality) into numeric form using **Label Encoding**.

- **Model Training & Testing**  
  Splitting the dataset into training and testing portions, then fitting a Decision Tree to the training data.

- **Evaluation & Visualization**  
  Measuring the model’s accuracy and visualizing the tree structure to understand how decisions are made.
